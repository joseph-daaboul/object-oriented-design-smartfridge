# object-oriented-design-smartfridge
This repository focuses on the design and analysis of a Smart Fridge Software System for a line of innovative, internet-enabled fridges.

The coursework required developing user requirements and analysis models for the SmartFridgeX system, including:
   Functional and non-functional requirements.
   UML diagrams to model the system's use cases, structure, and behavior.
   
The project demonstrates my ability to apply object-oriented principles and modeling techniques to design scalable and maintainable systems.
